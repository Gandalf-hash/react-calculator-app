Inside the terminal, you need to open the folder that contains the package.json file. This is because you need to install the node_modules folder using the"npm install" command, with your terminal pointing to the folder that contains the package.json file. You should be familiar with these steps.

Once the npm install command is finished, you can serve the app locally by running the "npm start" command, with your terminal still pointing at the folder containing your project.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code in the App.js file using any IDE.

1.Type the number 1 into the input field. Press the add button.
2.The 0 above the input change to 1 after you pressed the add button
3.Press the reset input button, then the reset result button, so that the number in the input field and above the input field are both reset to 0.
4.Type the number 10 into the input field. Press the add button. The 0 above the input should change to 10
5.Repeat step 3
6.Type the number 20 into the input field, then press the add button. With the number 20 now showing above the input field, and the number 20 showing inside the input field, press the divide button and repeat step 3
7.Type the number 100 into the input field, then press the add button. With the number 100 now showing above the input field, change the number in the input field to 60. Press the subtract button.
